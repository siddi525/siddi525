- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @siddi525

- I am a Data Science student with a wide variety of experience in the field. My skills range from programming languages to Machine learning and AI.

During my university, my analytical abilities through various roles in data analysis and machine learning. Notably, I have successfully designed and implemented predictive models for specific applications or industries. I have keen knowledge in programming languages like PYTHON, JAVA and C. Leveraging tools like Python and specialized libraries, I implemented various ML algorithms, from regression and classification models to advanced techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Through rigorous testing and fine-tuning, I ensured the models were optimized for accuracy and performance.

Experienced data analyst specializing in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data mining techniques, seeking a challenging position to leverage expertise in extracting valuable insights and patterns from complex datasets. Committed to uncovering actionable information to drive data-driven decision making and business growth.

I have been exposed to a wide variety of technologies in my career and consider myself to be very adaptable.
